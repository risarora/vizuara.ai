https://youtu.be/bLDlwcl6hbA

### Intro
In this tutorial-style overview, Dr. Raj Dandkar guides readers through constructing a 270-million-parameter language model, Gamma 3, entirely from scratch on a laptop with access to an A100 GPU on Google Colab. The aim is to democratize access to end-to-end open-source model development, from data collection to pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference—without relying on opaque, pre-trained weights alone. The talk blends practical code-walkthroughs, architectural explanations, and design trade-offs, emphasizing the complete pipeline, not just model weights.

**What Gamma 3 270M is, and why it matters**

- A small-language-model category model, roughly in the same ballpark as GPT‑2’s smallest version (≈124M) but scaled to 270M for more capable inferences, yet far from GPT‑4 or Gemini scales.
- Open-source-in-spirit: weights and tokenizer are downloadable, but the speaker stresses that true openness requires sharing the full pre-training workflow as well.

**Core objective of the workshop**

- Demonstrate an end-to-end pipeline: dataset import, tokenization, input–output pair creation, architecture assembly, pre-training, and inference.
- Make the process self-contained, enabling viewers to reproduce and adapt for other models (e.g., GPT OSS, Quinn, Kim K2) in future installments.

**High-level workflow (six steps)**

1) Load and prepare the dataset.  
2) Tokenize the text using subword tokenization (byte-pair encoding).  
3) Create input/output pairs for next-token prediction.  
4) Assemble the Gamma 3 architecture (18 transformer blocks with cutting-edge features).  
5) Pre-train with a carefully designed optimization loop.  
6) Deploy inference to generate coherent text.

**Data and task choices**

- Dataset: Tiny Stories (≈2 million training entries,≈20k validation), a domain-specific corpus shown to be sufficient for training smaller models to generate coherent English.
- Rationale: smaller, targeted datasets can still yield meaningful language behavior, questioning the assumption that huge datasets are always necessary.

**Tokenization strategy: why subword matters**

- Three tokenization schemes are weighed:
  - Character-level: ballooning context windows, loss of linguistic structure.
  - Word-based: large vocabularies lead to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues.
  - Subword (byte-pair encoding, BPE): balance between vocabulary size, coverage, and context; mitigates OOV while keeping vocabulary manageable.
- The chosen tokenization uses the Tick library (GPT‑2 style, 50257 tokens) to implement BPE-like subword units. Gamma 3’s tokenizer reportedly uses a larger vocabulary in its own release, but the workshop adopts 50257 for practical demonstration.

**Data representation and storage decisions**

- Token IDs for all training stories are stored on disk in train.bin and validation.bin, leveraging memory-mapped arrays (np.memmap) to enable fast data loading without RAM exhaustion.
- This design choice underpins efficient pre-training on limited hardware by streamlining data throughput during training.

**Model architecture: core building blocks**

- The Gamma 3 architecture consists of:
  - An input embedding stage that maps token IDs to high-dimensional vectors.
  - A processor comprising 18 transformer blocks, each with:
    - RMS normalization (with learnable scale and shift).
    - Attention layer variants: sliding window attention and occasional full causal attention (three full-attention blocks interspersed among fifteen sliding-attention blocks).
    - Rotary positional encodings (RPE) to inject positional information directly into queries and keys, avoiding additive positional embeddings on embeddings.
    - Multi-query attention (sharing keys/values across heads to save parameters).
    - A two-stage feed-forward network (expansion to a higher dimension and contraction back, with an extra parallel path to enhance expressivity).
    - Skip connections to preserve gradient flow.
  - An output layer that maps the final embedding back to a vocabulary-sized logits array for next-token prediction.
- Dimensional blueprint (as implemented in the lesson):
  - Embedding dimension: 640
  - Number of attention heads: 4
  - Head dimension: 256
  - Transformer blocks: 18
  - Context length (block size): 32768 for the larger model, with practical training runs using smaller windows
  - KV groups: 1 (true multi-query attention)
- The architecture emphasizes a balance between capacity and efficiency, using sliding attention to reduce the quadratic cost of full attention, and interleaving a few full-attention blocks to preserve essential long-range dependencies.

**Training choreography: how the model learns**

- Input–output pairing: within a batch, random contexts of length equal to the block size are sampled, and the ground-truth targets are the next tokens in sequence.
- Self-supervised learning: the model predicts the following token, generating its own supervision signals from the input.
- Loss function: cross-entropy computed against the ground-truth next-token targets; the batch loss is averaged to guide gradient updates.
- Optimization and efficiency:
  - Mixed precision (float16/float32) for speed and stability.
  - Gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes when memory is constrained.
  - AdamW optimizer with a learning-rate schedule featuring warm-up and decay to stabilize training.
- Data pipeline alignment: a get_batch function pulls random segments from the tokenized disk-backed train/validation data to drive training.

**Inference and evaluation**

- Inference is performed by a generate routine that iteratively feeds the produced tokens back into the model, selecting the maximum-probability token at each step to extend the sequence.
- Demonstrations show coherent English generation from prompts such as “Once upon a time there was a pumpkin,” illustrating successful learning despite modest parameter counts.

**Key design trade-offs highlighted**

- Sliding vs. full attention: sliding attention drastically reduces compute (roughly a 64x efficiency gain in some configurations) at the possible expense of some context; Gamma’s design mitigates this with a few full-attention blocks to retain long-range coherence.
- Multi-query attention: reduces parameter count and KV cache overhead by sharing keys/values across heads, trading a potential slight performance dip for substantial efficiency gains.
- Rotary positional encodings: preferred over absolute encodings to avoid distorting token meaning while encoding position information in a rotational space.
- RMS normalization: adopted across components for stable training in modern LLMs, paired with learnable scale/shift parameters to retain expressive capacity.

**Center: why this matters in practice**

- The speaker underscores that end-to-end open-source model workflows empower communities to reproduce, inspect, and improve foundational models from first principles.
- The approach demonstrated—tokenization, dataset preparation, transformer construction, and iterative pre-training—serves as a blueprint for future, even larger-scale projects, offering a pathway to transparency and customization in a field often dominated by proprietary pipelines.

### Outro
The session closes with a synthesis of six essential steps, a concise recap of novel components, and a call to action: embrace end-to-end openness, share code publicly, and invite others to remix and extend. The presenter notes that the same techniques can scale beyond Gamma 3 to larger projects like GPT OSS, Kim K2, and Quinn, culminating in a broader ecosystem where learning from scratch becomes accessible to researchers and developers at all levels. The tutorial ends with encouragement to experiment, to upload models to Hugging Face, and to join the ongoing conversation about open-source model-building. The overarching message is clear: meaningful language modeling does not require unrivaled resources alone; it requires transparent processes, thoughtful tokenization, efficient architectural choices, and a willingness to share the journey.



Study Guide: Building Gamma 3 (270M) from Scratch – End-to-End Language Model Tutorial

1) Quick Overview
- Goal: Demonstrate end-to-end construction of a small open-source language model (Gamma 3, 270M parameters) from scratch on a laptop with an A100 via Google Colab.
- Core idea: Start with data collection, tokenize, create input-output pairs, implement the Gamma 3 architecture, pre-train, and run inference.
- Key takeaway: Open source model = open weights + open code and process; training from scratch enables full openness.

2) Dataset and Data Preparation
- Dataset used: Tiny Stories (2 million training samples, ~20k validation), text stories designed for 3–4 year olds.
- Why Tiny Stories: Shows that a small model (tens of millions of parameters) can learn coherent English from domain-specific data; useful for end-to-end demonstration.
- Data loading:
  - Use Hugging Face datasets to load tiny stories.
  - Split: training ~2M samples, validation ~20k samples.
- Objective in data prep: Convert raw text into token IDs, store as binary files for efficient loading during training.

3) Tokenization: Subword Tokens (Block on Tokenization)
- Why not character-level: Ballooning context window (too many tokens); destroys word-level semantics.
- Why not word-level: Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issues; vocabulary huge; expensive for multilingual setups.
- Preferred approach: Subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding, BPE).
  - Benefits: Moderate vocabulary size, handles unseen words, reduces fragmentation, balances context length and expressiveness.
- Tokenizer choice in this workflow:
  - Use Tick tokenizer (GPT-2 style BPE).
  - Vocabulary size: 50257 (GPT-2 size).
  - Rationale: Commonly used in GPT-family models; good balance between vocabulary size and expressiveness.
- Tokenization pipeline:
  - Tokenize each story into token IDs using GPT-2 BPE vocabulary (via Tick).
  - Save token IDs to memory-mapped binary files on disk:
    - train.bin (training token IDs)
    - val.bin (validation token IDs)
- Important concept: Token IDs are the model’s input; the actual text is never fed during training.

4) Input-Output Pair Creation for Next-Token Prediction
- Task: Train the model to predict the next token given a context window.
- Context size (block size): The length of input token sequences (also called context window).
- Batch size: Number of input-output sequences processed in one update step.
- How to create a single training example:
  - Take a story segment: sequence of tokens [t1, t2, ..., tn].
  - Input: first k tokens (context length = k).
  - Output/Target: the next token (and the subsequent tokens, via shifting) for each position in the input sequence:
    - Example: If you choose context length 4, input could be [t1, t2, t3, t4], and the ground truth is [t2, t3, t4, t5] (shifted by one).
  - Intrinsic multi-task nature: For a context window of length L, there are L prediction tasks per input sequence (predicting t2, t3, t4, t5, etc., depending on how you align inputs and targets).
- Self-supervised and autoregressive:
  - The model learns from its own predictions; it’s not given explicit labels beyond the next-token targets.

5) Gamma 3 Architecture: Core Building Blocks
- Overall structure: Input block (embeddings), processor (transformer blocks), output block (logits over vocabulary).
- Major innovations/variants in Gamma 3 (and why they matter):
  - Sliding Window Attention (instead of full attention):
    - Each token attends to a limited window of previous tokens (e.g., 512-sized window in Gamma).
    - Reduces compute and memory from O(n^2) to something much smaller; enables longer context with fewer resources.
    - In Gamma 3, 15 transformer blocks use sliding attention; 3 blocks use full causal attention.
  - Multi-Query Attention (shared KV across heads):
    - Heads share the Key/Value projections (KV cache) to save memory and parameters.
    - Q matrices (queries) remain separate per head.
    - Trade-off: potential slight performance reduction vs. large gains in efficiency.
  - Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE):
    - Replaces absolute positional encodings added to embeddings.
    - Positions info is injected into the attention mechanism by rotating query/key vectors.
    - Benefits: Maintains magnitude of embeddings; better generalization and smoother handling of position across layers.
  - QK RMS Norm (QK normalization):
    - Apply RMS normalization to the query and key vectors before computing attention scores.
    - Stabilizes training and improves convergence in transformer layers.
  - Feed-Forward Network (FFN) design:
    - Typical two-layer expansion-contraction with GELU (JU) activation in one path.
    - Gamma 3 uses a dual-path FFN: one pathway with activation, another without activation; combined to enrich representational power.
  - Residual connections and RMS Norm:
    - Each transformer block uses skip connections and multiple RMS norms (pre- and post- attention/FFN) to improve gradient flow.
- Architecture depth and sizes (as in Gamma 3):
  - Transformer blocks: 18 blocks total.
  - Embedding dimension: 640.
  - Attention: 4 heads; head dimension = 256; total D_out = 4 * 256 = 1024 for attention output (then projected back to 640).
  - Context length: 32768 (long sequences are feasible with sliding attention).
  - Vocab size: 50257 (GPT-2 style tokenizer).
- Schematic of data flow in one transformer block:
  - Token IDs -> Embeddings (size: sequence length x 640) -> RMS Norm -> Attention (sliding window or full; RoPE applied to Q/K) -> Residual/Norm -> FFN -> Residual/Norm -> (end of block)
  - After 18 such blocks, apply final RMS Norm, then output projection to vocabulary size (logits) for next-token prediction.

6) Dimensionality Walkthrough (Concrete Example)
- Embedding dimension: 640
- Sequence length in this example: 4 tokens
- After embedding: 4 x 640
- In attention: D_out = heads * head_dim = 4 * 256 = 1024
- Attention output projection brings 1024 back to 640 (via a linear layer)
- After residuals and FFN, the per-token dimension remains 640
- Final projection: 4 x 640 (per-token) -> 4 x 50257 logits (per-token probabilities for vocabulary)
- Visualization concept: Each token embedding becomes context-rich through attention; RoPE injects positional info; multi-head and multi-query reduce parameters while maintaining multiple perspectives.

7) Training Setup and Pre-Training Details
- Precision: Mixed precision (float16 where safe; float32 for softmax, loss, and weight updates)
- Gradient accumulation: Simulates larger batch sizes than can fit in memory (e.g., accumulate over 32 micro-batches before updating).
- Optimizer: AdamW
- Learning rate schedule: Warm-up followed by decay (dynamic learning rate to balance exploration and convergence)
- Loss: Cross-entropy (cross-entropy over each position; compute average across batch and positions)
- Batch construction during training:
  - get_batch function samples random input sequences of length = context window; outputs are shifted targets.
  - For each batch: compute logits for the batch, compute loss, backpropagate, apply gradient accumulation, then update parameters.
- Input/output pairing in code:
  - get_batch returns X (input IDs), Y (targets, next-token targets aligned with X)
- Data handling:
  - Use memory-mapped train.bin and val.bin to efficiently stream data from disk without loading all data into RAM.

8) Pre-Training Pipeline: Step-by-Step (Summary)
- Step 1: Data loading and tokenization
  - Load tiny stories from Hugging Face datasets
  - Tokenize with GPT-2 BPE (50257) via Tick tokenizer
  - Save to disk as train.bin and val.bin (memory-mapped)
- Step 2: Create input-output pairs
  - Define context length (block size) and batch size
  - Create batches by sampling random sequences and producing target sequences by shifting
- Step 3: Implement Gamma 3 architecture (Transformer blocks with RoPE, sliding attention, multi-query)
  - Embedding + RMS Norm + attention + FFN + residuals
- Step 4: Compute loss and backprop
  - Forward pass through the model
  - Compute cross-entropy loss between logits and targets
  - Backpropagate with gradient accumulation
- Step 5: Pre-training loop
  - Mixed precision
  - Gradient accumulation steps
  - AdamW optimization
  - Learning-rate scheduling
  - Save best model parameters (checkpointing)
- Step 6: Inference
  - Generate text by feeding initial prompt and sampling token by token
  - Use best model parameters to generate up to a max token limit

9) Inference: Text Generation
- Generation procedure:
  - Provide an initial prompt (e.g., "Once upon a time there was a pumpkin")
  - Run generate: repeatedly feed current text tokens into the model, take the argmax (or sampling) for the next token, append, repeat
  - Stop after a fixed number of tokens or on a stop condition
- Observations:
  - Coherent English can emerge from training on a relatively small dataset and a modest parameter count (270M).
