## Mathematical Approach to Understanding Vector Position – 00:40:36

- Showed how tokens are represented as **vectors** in high-dimensional space.
- Explained how **positional encoding** injects order information into embeddings.
- Discussed the role of **mathematical functions (sine, cosine)** in positional encodings.

## Creating Input-Output Pairs for Training – 00:46:11

- Demonstrated building **training pairs** from raw text.
- Used an example with a **context size of 4 tokens** to illustrate how the model learns step by step.
- Highlighted the importance of **visualizing token sequences** to understand model behavior.

---

## Context Window and Stride in Input-Output Pairs – 00:52:12

- Explained the role of **stride** in controlling overlap between training sequences.
- Larger stride = less overlap, faster training but fewer pairs.
- Smaller stride = more overlap, more pairs, higher computational cost.

---

## Data Loader and Target Chunk Creation – 00:58:08

- Discussed how the data loader creates **chunks** of text sequences.
- Explained how each chunk is split into:

  - **Input IDs** (X)
  - **Target IDs** (Y).

  - **Sequence diversity**.
  - **Model generalization**.

---

## Converting Text to Token IDs and Embedding – 01:11:58

- Explained the step-by-step process:

  1. Raw text → Tokenization.
  2. Tokens → Token IDs.
  3. Token IDs → **Embedding vectors**.

- Highlighted that embeddings encode **semantic meaning** of words.
- Showed how embeddings form the **input layer** of a transformer model.
