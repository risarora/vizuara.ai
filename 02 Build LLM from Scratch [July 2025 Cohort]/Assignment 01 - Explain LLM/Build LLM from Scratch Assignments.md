**Assignment 1:** 

### **Teaching Assignment: Explaining Large Language Models to a 15-Year-Old**

**Objective:**  
The goal of this assignment is to simplify the concept of Large Language Models (LLMs) and explain it in a way that a 15-year-old student can understand. 

**Use your preferred format of recording (either 1 or 2 below):**

1. **PPT Presentation/Whiteboard Notes**: Create a simple and visually engaging slide deck or whiteboard notes. Your face needs to be visible on the bottom right.   
2. **Video Recording**: Record yourself explaining the concept clearly and enthusiastically.

***Use tools like loom.com or veed.io for high quality recording.*** 

**Video duration:** 5-10 minutes

*Remember that a 15 year old kid can understand logic and probability, but not too much beyond that.* 

*How would you explain LLMs from first principles? Remember: don't record unless you have fully understood the concept. If you start using fancy words like neural networks or transformers etc, you probably have not understood LLMs from the very basics.*
