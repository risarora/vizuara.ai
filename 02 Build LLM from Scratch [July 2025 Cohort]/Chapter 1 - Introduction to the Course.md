### Creating a Chatbot With OpenAI Library in Google Colab

I explained how to use the OpenAI library in Google Colab notebook to create a chatbot. I demonstrated how to install the library and shared a key for the API.

### Google Colab Notebook Probability Experiment

I shared a Google Colab notebook with the participants and asked them to change a sentence and observe the probability.

### Team's Experiments With Statements and Models

I discussed the team's experiments with different statements and models. We tried three types of statements: a generic one, a factual one, and a proverb.

### Model Confidence in Predicting Next Word

I discussed the concept of a model's confidence in predicting the next word in a sequence.

### Model Selection for Specific Tasks

**I discussed the importance of selecting the appropriate model for a specific task, considering factors such as cost and performance.**
